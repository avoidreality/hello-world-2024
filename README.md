Hello World repository for Git tutorial 

This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial. 

The "master" branch on my computer is called "main". YMMV. 

You will probably need to create your own fine-grained personal access token, that is not mentioned in the w3schools tutorial as of today (4/5/2024). You need this to push to GitHub. 
`git push --set-upstream origin main`

Git has many commands. Does anyone use them all?
